I tried resizing it everything to a phone's size using media queries but I was unable to do it very nicely. I couldn't replicate the animations while using media queries.

Spilz
-The app has two sections Global and NIT Durgapur, which sorts the posts based on which Club it was posted on. In NIT Durgapur section, only those posts are shown which are posted in the Clubs of NIT Durgapur, which are Incognito Confession, Vent out @NIT Durgapur and NIT Durgapur talks.
-Users are allowed to have anonimity by choosing whatever they want as their usernames and picking a display picture from some predefined images. It is like a Twitter or Reddit for communities like Colleges where you can log in only with the email-ID which your college has sent you.
-The different Clubs allow people to seperate their posts and make sure their words reach the right audience and readers can also seperate the posts to make sure they read what they want to see.
-The Global Clubs allow students from colleges all over the country to interact and share views.

Few drawbacks of the app are:
-It maybe done on purpose to maintain the anonimity of an user but you cannot view an user's profile to check his/her previous activity. 
-You can't see when a post was posted on the platform.
-The three dots on the right corner of the post is misleading because it isn't clickable.
-Once you've interacted with a post(liked/disliked), you cannot reverse that action.
